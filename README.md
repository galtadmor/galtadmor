#### ðŸ‘‹ Hey there!

My name is Gal Tadmor, and I'm an Engineering Team Lead. I'm 30 years old, kickin' it in Tel Aviv, Israel. I've been developing since high school, and it's still pretty damn fun. I am currently working at Big Panda.

My development projects focus on end-to-end systems, creating SaaS platforms, user interfaces, websites and games, for all devices. I keep UX in mind, by adding animations, icons and anything else, that will make the difference between a very good product and a great one. Iâ€™m a fast learner, and I love researching new technologies.
