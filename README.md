#### ðŸ‘‹ Hey there!

My name is Gal Tadmor, and I'm a full stack developer. I'm 30 years old, kickin' it in Tel Aviv, Israel. I've been a developer for 16 years, and it's still pretty damn fun. I am currently working at [Big Panda](https://bigpanda.io).<br/>

My work focuses on end-to-end projects, creating SaaS platforms, user interfaces, websites and games, for all devices. I keep UX in mind, by adding animations, icons and anything else, that will make the difference between a very good product and a great one. Iâ€™m a fast learner, and I love researching new technologies.<br/>
